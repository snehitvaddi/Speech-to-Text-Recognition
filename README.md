# Speech-to-Text-Recognition
In this repo you have two python3 jupyter-notebook files "speech-to-text using Audio file" and "Speech-to-text with Microphones" for speech to text conversion.
For testing purpose I included audio files also
      1. harvars.wav - normal audio file.
      2. jackhammer.wav - audio file with noice.
Just follow the documentation given in jupyter files given.
